# palindrome-detector
The purpose of this project is to teach unit test and TDD.

**Rules**:

- If the word is not palindrome, should return false.
- If the word is palindrome, should return true.
- Should validate if the word is empty.
- Should validate if the word is null.

**Branches**:
- *solution-implemented-without-tests*: if you want to practice only unit tests, this branch has the implementation done for you.
- *only-method-signature-with-tests-declaration*: here we have only the signature of the methods and the test cases.
- *only-method-signature*: here you only have the signature of the method *isPalindrome()*.
- *solution-implemented-with-tests*: here everything is already implemented.
